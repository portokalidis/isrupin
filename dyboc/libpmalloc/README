Run `make' to build everything.

libpmalloc.so defines guards before and after allocated buffers. Buffers are
allocated as close as possible to the right guard to favor early detection of
overflows. However, alignment requirements for malloc and posix_memalign may
also introduce right padding. malloc uses a sizeof(void *) alignment, while
posix_memalign uses the alignment specified by the developer.

libpmalloc_under.so defines a guard before allocated buffers. Buffers are
allocated as close as possible to the left guard to favor early detection of
underflows.


libpmalloc creates multiple mappings for each allocations. To ensure smooth
operation the maximum maps count in Linux need to be increased.

For the current max count run:
$ more /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count

To modify it run (use maximum count possible):
$ sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=2000000 (for example)

To permanently apply the change add the following in /etc/sysctl.conf:
vm.max_map_count=200000


IMPORTANT:
It looks like gcc (GCC) 4.8.2 is producing buggy code when using -O3 (or at
least that's my explanation for now). The manifestation was in
mark_magic_number().
