Run `make' to build everything.

libpmalloc.so defines guards before and after allocated buffers. Buffers are
allocated as close as possible to the right guard to favor early detection of
overflows. However, alignment requirements for malloc and posix_memalign may
also introduce right padding. malloc uses a sizeof(void *) alignment, while
posix_memalign uses the alignment specified by the developer.

libpmalloc_under.so defines a guard before allocated buffers. ...


libpmalloc creates multiple mappings for each allocations. To ensure smooth
operation the maximum maps count in Linux need to be increased.

For the current max count run:
$ more /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count

To modify it run (use maximum count possible):
$ sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=200000) (for example)
