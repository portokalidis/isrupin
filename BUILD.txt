Requirements:
- CMAKE 2.6 or greater (http://www.cmake.org/)
- Intel's Pin (see PIN_VERSION for version number)

Instructions:
CMake is used to create Makefiles in a portable way. The preferred way is
out-of-source building. This means you invoke cmake in a new empty, where all
the build files are created, and the project is built.
So after changing to the directory where you want to build the project run:
$ cmake /path/to/source
$ make

To enable debug mode
$ cmake -DDEBUG=ON /path/to/source
$ make

For other configuration options run cmake -LAH <source directory>
